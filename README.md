# Eat the burger

A CRUD application for adding and marking items complete using MySQL and handlebars.
You can add an item using the text area and it will show as available. Once it has been checked as eaten it will move to the eaten column.

The files are seperated per proper MVC standards. Express, Express-Handlebars and Body-Parser are all dependencies.

###Instructions

* Add burger by typing in name to the search bar. This will add the burger to the MySQL as uneaten.

* Click the *eat me!* button to eat the burger. This will mark as eaten in the database. Burger name will move to the devoured section.
